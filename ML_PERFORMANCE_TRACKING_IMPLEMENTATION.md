# ML Performance Tracking Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of real ML performance tracking that aggregates from actual strategy usage, replacing the previous mock data system.

## Architecture

### 1. Database Schema

Two new PostgreSQL tables have been created:

#### `ml_strategy_signals`
- Tracks individual ML strategy signals with entry/exit data
- Calculates PnL automatically when exit data is provided
- Stores metadata and confidence scores
- Indexes on strategy_name, symbol, and timestamp for performance

#### `ml_training_log`
- Tracks ML model training events
- Records accuracy, duration, data points used
- Stores training status and error messages

### 2. Core Components

#### `MLPerformanceTracker` Class
Located in `tradebot/strategy/ml_service.py`

**Key Methods:**
- `log_signal()` - Records new ML strategy signals
- `update_signal_exit()` - Updates signals with exit data and calculates PnL
- `log_training_event()` - Records model training events
- `get_strategy_performance()` - Retrieves metrics for specific strategy
- `get_all_ml_performance()` - Retrieves metrics for all ML strategies

#### Global Performance Tracker
- Singleton instance managed by `initialize_performance_tracker()`
- Automatically initialized when dashboard starts
- Shared across all ML strategies

### 3. ML Strategy Integration

All ML strategies have been updated with performance tracking:

#### `EnsembleMLStrategy`
- Logs signals with strategy name "ensemble_ml"
- Tracks model training events
- Asynchronous signal logging to avoid blocking

#### `LSTMStrategy`  
- Logs signals with strategy name "lstm_ml"
- Records TensorFlow model training metrics
- Handles fallback scenarios

#### `SentimentStrategy`
- Logs signals with strategy name "sentiment_ml"  
- Tracks sentiment analysis accuracy
- Records news sentiment fetching events

#### `RLStrategy`
- Logs signals with strategy name "rl_ml"
- Tracks reinforcement learning training episodes
- Records environment performance metrics

### 4. Dashboard Integration

#### Updated `/api/ml-performance` Endpoint
- **Before:** Returned hardcoded mock data
- **After:** Queries real database for actual performance metrics
- Returns empty/zero data when no performance tracker available
- Graceful error handling with fallback responses

#### Real-Time Data Structure
```json
{
  "performance": {
    "ensemble_ml": {
      "signals": 45,
      "wins": 28, 
      "total_pnl": 1247.50,
      "avg_pnl": 27.72
    },
    // ... other strategies
  },
  "training_status": {
    "ensemble_ml": {
      "status": "completed",
      "last_training": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
      "model_accuracy": 0.68
    },
    // ... other strategies
  }
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic PnL Calculation
- Calculates profit/loss when exit data is provided
- Handles both buy and sell signals correctly
- Tracks winning vs losing trades

### 2. Comprehensive Metrics
- **Total signals** - Count of all signals generated
- **Win rate** - Percentage of profitable trades
- **Total/Average PnL** - Profit and loss tracking
- **Profit factor** - Ratio of gross profit to gross loss
- **Model accuracy** - Latest training accuracy
- **Training status** - Current model state

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Database indexes for fast queries
- Connection pooling for efficiency
- Asynchronous operations to avoid blocking
- Automatic cleanup of old data

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when database unavailable
- Fallback to empty metrics on errors
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- No impact on strategy execution if tracking fails

## Usage Examples

### Signal Logging (Automatic)
```python
# In ML strategy on_tick method
signal = Signal(symbol="AAPL", side=Side.buy, price=150.25, ...)
# Automatically logged via _log_signal() helper
asyncio.create_task(self._log_signal(signal, "ensemble_ml"))
```

### Manual Performance Queries
```python
from tradebot.strategy.ml_service import get_performance_tracker

tracker = await get_performance_tracker()
metrics = await tracker.get_strategy_performance("ensemble_ml")
print(f"Win rate: {metrics.win_rate:.1f}%")
```

### Training Event Logging
```python
await tracker.log_training_event(
    "ensemble_ml", 
    "completed", 
    accuracy=0.68, 
    duration=120, 
    data_points=1000
)
```

## Testing

📝 Logged signal 2: AAPL SELL at 152.5  
📝 Logged signal 3: TSLA BUY at 220.75
🎯 Logged training events
🔄 Updated signal 1 with exit price 151.80
📊 Ensemble ML Performance:
   - Total signals: 2
   - Winning signals: 0
   - Win rate: 0.0%
   - Total PnL: $-1.55
   - Training status: completed
```

## Migration from Mock Data

### Before
- Dashboard showed hardcoded performance data
- No actual tracking of strategy signals
- No correlation between displayed metrics and real performance

### After  
- Dashboard shows real performance data from database
- All ML strategies automatically log their signals
- True correlation between strategy execution and displayed metrics
- Historical tracking for performance analysis

## Configuration

### Database Requirements
- PostgreSQL database with asyncpg driver
- Tables created automatically on first run
- Requires `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### Dependencies Added
- `asyncpg>=0.29.0` - PostgreSQL async driver
- Database connection pooling
- JSON metadata storage support

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Real-time WebSocket updates** - Push performance updates to dashboard
2. **Historical performance charts** - Time-series visualization
3. **Strategy comparison tools** - Side-by-side performance analysis
4. **Automated model retraining** - Based on performance thresholds
5. **Risk metrics** - Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, etc.
6. **Performance alerts** - Notifications for significant changes

### Scalability Considerations
- Database partitioning for large signal volumes
- Data archival for long-term storage
- Caching layer for frequently accessed metrics
- Distributed tracking for multi-instance deployments

## Conclusion

The ML performance tracking system provides a robust foundation for monitoring and analyzing ML trading strategy performance. It replaces mock data with real, actionable metrics while maintaining system performance and reliability.

Key benefits:
- **Transparency** - Real performance data instead of mock data
- **Accountability** - Actual tracking of strategy decisions
- **Optimization** - Data-driven strategy improvement
- **Reliability** - Graceful error handling and fallbacks
- **Scalability** - Designed for production usage

The implementation successfully bridges the gap between strategy execution and performance visualization, providing traders with accurate, real-time insights into their ML trading systems.
